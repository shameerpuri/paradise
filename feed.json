></p>\n<p><span class=\"notranslate\">A few days ago <strong>the developer of the Linux distribution Elive announced</strong> through a statement on his blog the availability of <strong>the new version of the distribution.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"notranslate\">Thus Thanatermesis blog announcement:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"notranslate\">After 8 years of silent development, the third stable version of Elive is available, the result is simply incredible and the integration is magnificent, it is not even possible to describe each internal function and the new website only contains a small portion of its features.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"notranslate\">Unfortunately, not everything is rainbow and perfection, the lack of resources caused the launch to be delayed too much, and this led to old packages and controllers, but despite that, the final result is really worth it, Elive 3.0 is the most useful that was created.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"notranslate\">Under the hood, <strong>Elive 3.0 is based on Debian 7 (“Wheezy”), along with the</strong> adapted <strong>Enlightenment 17 desktop environment</strong> .</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"notranslate\">Elive <strong>only requires 192 MB of main memory</strong> according to system requirements <strong>and is only available as a 32-bit version</strong> , with kernel that uses PAE.</span> <span class=\"notranslate\">The distribution is not compatible with UEFI firmware, but it also runs on older hardware.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"notranslate\">The latter, however, takes 24 hours.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"notranslate\">Basically in this new version of the distribution we can highlight:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"notranslate\">Improved designs and beautiful interfaces made by professional designers.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"notranslate\">Better performance, integrity and features.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"notranslate\">More tools to make your own hacks and customizations.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"notranslate\">Make many ideas come
